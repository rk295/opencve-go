# opencve-go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/rk295/opencve-go/opencve.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rk295/opencve-go/opencve)

This package is a Go client library for the [https://www.opencve.io/](https://www.opencve.io/) API. Almost all functionality is currentlyc covered but it should still be considered a work in progres.

## Usage

To print the details of the most recent CVEs init the client and call the `CVE().List()` function without any filters:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/rk295/opencve-go/opencve"
)

func main(){
	ctx := context.Background()
	api, _ := opencve.New(ctx, "username", "password", nil)
	list, _ := api.CVE().List(ctx, &opencve.CVEListOptions{})
	
	for _, cve := range *list {
		fmt.Printf("%s - %s\n", cve.ID, cve.Summary)
	}
}
```

## Examples

There is an example in the [examples/gitlab](examples/gitlab) directory which demonstrates how to configure the client and fetch a single page of CVEs for a given product.
