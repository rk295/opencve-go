# opencve-go

This package is a Go client library for the [https://www.opencve.io/](https://www.opencve.io/) API. Almost all functionality is currentlyc covered but it should still be considered a work in progres.

## Usage

To print the details of the most recent CVEs init the client and call the `CVE().List()` function without any filters:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/rk295/opencve-go/opencve"
)

func main(){
	api, _ := opencve.New("username", "password", nil)
	list, _ := api.CVE().List(context.Background(), &opencve.CVEListOptions{})

	for _, cve := range *list {
		fmt.Printf("%s - %s\n", cve.ID, cve.Summary)
	}
}
```

## Examples

There are some examples in the [examples/](examples/) directory which demonstrates how to configure the client and perform various functions.
